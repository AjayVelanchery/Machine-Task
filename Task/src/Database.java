//
//Create a Java program that defines an Employee class with the following fields:
//
//String name;
//double salary;
//LocalDate joiningDate;
//Optional<String> department;
//
//Then perform the following operations:
//
//        1. Use a functional interface and a lambda expression to calculate and print a 10% bonus for each employee.
//
//        2. Use the Stream API to:
//        - Filter employees who joined after 2020
//        - Map employee names to uppercase
//    - Count how many employees have a salary greater than ₹50,000
//        3. Use the Date and Time API to calculate and print each employee’s years of service.
//        4. Use the Optional class to safely print each employee’s department, or "Not Assigned" if absent.
//5. Create a Runnable thread to print each employee's name with a 1-second delay.
